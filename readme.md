## hausofbids metadata protocol
this protocol contains the schema used to inscribed collectible slabs as bitcoin ordinal.

on may 28th (utc 29th),
i've inscribed what i consider the first rwa-ordinal.
i'm a pokemon tcg collector,
and my passion extends to more realms like art, historical pieces, and others.

the inscription process is very easy, and i want to bring it to the public.
i'm backed up by common knowledge technology with bitcoin sovereign,
and the only goal is to create an immutable asset to verify, bring transparency, and possibly financial opportunities to the collectible world.

this humble protocol will continue developing as soon as we see the gap for improvement,
meaning that in our roadmap there isn't such a thing as a limit.
i see things moving from 'a' to 'infinite',
whatever happens during that process or period of time it'll be determined by it's own path.

this is proof-of-immutability.

thank you for accepting my first project ever.
