i've been absent for a while, i currently have 3 ordinals inscribed with our metadata scheem.

#96900790 2025-05-28 07:28:49 run into a minor bug after inscription. i didn't set up correctly the word pokemon with a tilde, so it broke the metadata.
#96901872 2025-05-28 08:30:26 it's the new inscription i made to fix the first issue, determining to keep it without a tilde as a universal word.
#97381790 2025-06-11 02:19:27 shows a more refined inscription with copyright, license, metadata latest version, collection name, and others. again, didn't set up the copyright symbol correctly.
#inscription_update it's ready, and fixed the symbol issue.

while writing this commitment, i realized that i'd like to see how to modify pokemon to keep it with a tilde for respect to the original branding. we'll figure it out.
